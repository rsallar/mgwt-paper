mgwt-paper
==========

Bringing material-designed polymer-paper elements to MGWT.

## Status
Depolymerized touch ripple effect and applied to slightly modified MGWT widgets.  Tried to avoid modifying widget by updating the look using the appearance pattern.  In some cases encapulation had to be broken and the widgets were modified. 

See: https://github.com/siderakis/mgwt/commit/53f7d2faf200bc25818c492c2ea2a66fbefd10fa
